# datascience_portfolio
This is my data science portfolio. 

All my notebooks are from kaggle competitions which you can check out my profile ->  kaggle.com/shaanbarca
I have also included my work in seminar, prior to my exposure to data science and included all information i could disclose as project is still on going for now.

Im currently working on implementing deep learning on various projects and will continuously update this repository.

For any questions please email shaanbarca@keio.jp. 

Thank you for reading :)
