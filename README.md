This is my data science portfolio. 

All my notebooks are from kaggle datasets. You can check out my profile @ -->  kaggle.com/shaanbarca

projects include =

1.) Odakyu X Keio Electronic Bike sharing 

2.) Clustering problem - market segmentation of mall customers using a K-Means

3.) Housing data vizualization

4.) Titanic data exploration + preprocessing + feature engineering + XGBoost classifier 

5.) Titanic solution = using alternate solution (my own) 

6.) Anomaly detection ( WIP unsupervised learning + visualization)

I have also included my work in seminar, prior to my exposure to data science and included all information i could disclose as the project is still on going for now.

I'm currently working on computer vision projects...  I will continuously update this repository.

For any questions please email shaanbarca@keio.jp. 

Thank you for reading :).
